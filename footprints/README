NOTE: These ascii footprints are *not* used to define streams in the library. 
They are provided as supplementary data for non-Python users.

The galstreams.footprint.ALL.dat can be used in TOPCAT to add a plot layer
showing all known streams. The galstreams.footprint.ALL.reflabels.dat file
contains a single point per stream and serves to quickly overplot each
stream's name using TOPCAT.
